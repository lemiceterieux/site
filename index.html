<h3>Work</h3>
<p>
    This will be mostly giving a short summary of some of my publications and
    some conference papers I'm writing. I have a lot of other work in the
    pipeline to be published soon. This will update as they get published.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> <p>
    My latest publication <a
    href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.104.064208">(Ghouse
            et al 2021, Physical Review E)</a> is about using
    Gaussian processes to infer directionality of coupled physical systems using
    the principles of convergent cross-mapping (CCM--Sugihara et al 2012, Science). The
    main idea, as illustrated in (Sugihara et al 2012, Science) is that delay-coordinate
    maps on a single variable time series are diffeomorphic (gradient preserving) to the original
    system. This should imply that if we reconstruct phase spaces using
    delay-coordinates from two different time series, we should see information
    of putative (causal) variables retrievable in the phase space reconstructed
    from the caused variable. On the other hand, all information of the caused
    variable may not be able to be retrieved from a phase space reconstructed
    from a time series reconstructed from the putative variable.</p>
    <p>
    My contribution is to place a probability distribution on each point in the
    phase space. Doing that, we can construct likelihood ratio tests, similar to
    what you may see in a discriminant analysis test, to infer the most likely
    direction of coupling between these two a priori assumed coupled variables
    we observe through some measured time series. More concretely, we assume the
    phase space reconstructed from a time series is a realization of a Gaussian
    process with an a priori mean and covariance function. Determining point
    estimates of parameters of the a prior functions from a maximum marginal
    likelihood optimization, we can then determine the a posteriori likelihood
    of a phase space reconstructed from a variable  we're testing to
    see is causing the variable that optimized the gaussian process mean and
    covariance functions.
    </p>
    <li>
    <p> My conference submission to the Organization of Human Brain
    mapping concerns using multivoxel pattern analysis on cortical surface
    reconstructions to decode neural representations of tasting when there is a
    nutrition claim. Food claims in general have a large literature of research,
    most famously the Coke vs. Pepsi paper (McClure et al 2004, Neuron), where
    it was found that preferences can be decoded particularly in the
    ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, the neural food valuation is
    modified by nutrition claims, i.e. what is told to the consumer about the
    food (Enax and Weber 2017, JAFIO).
    </p>
    <p>
    My main curiosity, personally, is how the active sensory experience is
    modulated by the fact that there's a nutrition claim. To be honest, the
    fact that the general sensory experience can be impacted by the stories we tell
    ourselves, or the stories we hear is curious. Particularly, it's
    fascinating to think that there's an intrinsic coupling between what our expectations
    of a sensation may be and the sensation itself. It kind of gives some
    credence to the mind over matter mantra. Though, of course I'd not claim
    that at an absolute.
    </p>
    <p>
    Another thing that was fun was learning about very advanced methodology used
    in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. For example, the
    decoding analysis pipeline, constructing classifiers and exploring the size
    of radii and their effect at uncovering neural representations, i.e. the
    spatial scale of local neural codes, was a fun foray of
    research. Furthermore, understanding the process of cortical surface
    reconstruction was pretty fun too. How different matters were
    segmented and mapped to an inflated surface, and how to standardize results
    over varying anatomical surfaces, was cool.

    My first "first author" publication
    <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/neu.2019.6965?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">(Fischer, Ghouse et al 2020, Journal of Neurotrauma)</a>
    was effectively my master's thesis work
    to develop a machine learning model that uses the methodology we used in our
    laboratory back in Barcelona--i.e. diffuse correlation spectroscopy
    (DCS)--to predict intracranial pressure. The skull can be seen as an
    incompressible box that can only be consumed by brain matter, blood, and
    cerebral spinal fluid. Brain is a constant, and as intracranial pressure
    changes, that means either one of blood of cerebral spinal fluid increased
    (Monroe-Kelly doctrine). This is especially important to monitor during a
    brain injury, or for hydrocephalus, where swelling may occur due to an
    increase of cerebral spinal fluid for example. This could impair perfusion
    of blood oxygen to tissue, given by the important formula CPP = MAP- ICP,
    where the perfusion pressure (CPP) would decrease as intracranial pressure
    (ICP) increases and mean arterial pressure (MAP) stays the same. My solution
    was effectively to make a recurrent neural network that takes standardized
    blood flow time series observed by DCS in the frontal regions of the head
    to analyze the time dynamics of the signals in order to see if it can be
    mapped to invasive intracranial pressures. Though the original goal was to
    classify severity levels of ICP (low, medium, high), we found that we were able to
    determine absolute pressure, which was fascinating. Even if absolute
    pressure were unreliable, at least being able to determine dynamical features like
    intracranial pressure waves can provide the neurotrauma doctors important
    information on the health of the patient!

    <p>My first paper I published in my PhD <a
    href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/7/761">(Ghouse et al 2020,
            Entropy)</a> was an
    analysis of various entropy analyses in reconstructed phase spaces to see if
    it added any additional information in nonparametric
    statistical rank analysis for uncovering neural correlates from fNIRS. To be honest, it was a
    very introductory work to get me up to speed with the foundations of my PhD
    work. </p>

  <h3>About me</h3>

  <p><i>"I want inside this night that is longer than life. I want, inside this
  night, life raw and bloody and full of saliva. I want this word: splendidness,
  splendidness is the fruit in its succulence, fruit without sadness. I want
  distances. My wild intuition about myself. But my main thing is always hidden.
  I am implicit. And when I make myself explicit I lose the humid intimacy." </i>--
  Clarice Lispector, Agua Viva</p>

  <p>I've been working in computational neuroscience the past
  3 years of my PhD under the guise of a program of information engineering at
  the University of Pisa. I enjoy learning about neural mechanisms, representations of cognitive states in
  the brain, emergent phenomenon that come from dynamic and complex systems,
  and maths and physics in general.</p>
  <p>I think my passion for cognitive science came
  from a cathartic moment in my early 20s when I realized one--just how little I knew about
  myself, why I feel things, why I succumb to certain patterns and two--my
  general limited understanding of the complexity of the conscious experience of
  others. I first delved into big literature to flourish and tickle this intense
  curiosity of mine. Then, considering I was near the end of my bachelor's program in biomedical
  engineering, I tried to reconcile that career path I was on with this
  uncovered desire of knowledge I had. I have been really fortunate to have such
  inspiring interactions during whlie living in
  Barcelona for three years, meeting some of the most brilliant people I know at Institut de
  Ciencies Fotonicas--where I further fostered deep fondness for physics and
  maths--and Universitat Pompeu Fabra--at my masters where I could really focus
  more on intimate matters in the philosophy of cognitive sciences and bleeding
  edge research in cognition, and its computational aspects, etc. All this built
  me up to work on the edge of
  cognitive sciences with computational neurosciences, particularly the
  concept of dynamical and complex systems, umbrella terms for which the brain
  falls under. Some of my work
  does also try to reconcile perceptions, awareness, decision making, reward circuitry, motor
  cognition, etc.</p> 
  <p>I wish to find more experience, whether that's in industry or
  academia. I truly believe greater knowledge of abstract neural mechanics, dynamics, large
  scale interactions, embodied conscious experience, etc, can be a powerful frontier to
  cross. I believe this is true both for our general understanding of our own conscious experience, and
  two for studying many complex psychological phenomena or aiding in
  psychological impairments</p>

  <p>When I'm not doing that, you can find me writing poetry, playing my guitar or
  learning a new instrument, learning and creating audiovisual arts, or reading
  books.
