A warm embrace among frigid sweets
On creamy covered mountain peaks
Peeked a torch to flambée
The sky caramelized and brûlée
Popping the last strident rays (of the day)
Spilling sparkling drips of honey
Sliding its way thru the slope's jagged teeth
Where I dared to be a bird opening my beak
To swallow the last morsel
Of a magnificent May
