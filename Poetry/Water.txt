Why--
When my heels held ocean waves,
Could I walk?
As the sea hit the shore
How it carved the bedrock
With every step herefore.
I feel I go forward
But I must say
My feet once felt so heavy
Whirling with water

How many have passed?
Crews teeming with--
Thousands?
Clacks of flasks
Smiles made of rubber bands
A maddening mutiny
I don't know?
It's a fare Sea
How many crews?

These waters
How much was seen?
A mastodon? He drank
From the callus
Protruding ever so slightly
From where feet meet sand
And I feel a pit of iron seen
Where sank submarines

But,
Does all of that matter?
What about that time
As my tides slowly breeched
Against the rocks,
Cutting through the thick terrain
When my waters
Briefly touched yours!

Do you remember
Your school of salmon?
Forming loops on your hands
Where my delirious Dolphins
Would somersault into--
From my ankles
Up to the current
That flowed in your fingers
Painting arcs of phosphorescent
Blue that scintillated
Amongst the stars
That sparkled their lucid rays
Against our specular seas

It was summer wasn't it?
I felt all that happened
Each passing day was a storm
They were splattered
Like the debris of a drunken ship
Floating north or west
And thru all that turbulence
A treasure
I once thought was sunken
Crashed to my shores

I try hard and I really don't know
But,
From the fresh port of your nails
To the harsh harbors at the bay
Of my toes
I just want to say
As we danced and splashed waves
Kicking up the verdant algae
On my seabed stuck to my sole
And the thick moss
That tickled the tender docks
Of your palms
It really is true that
You opened your rich channels
And your waters surged to me
And I was that much less salty
